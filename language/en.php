$lang['Home_welcome_text'] = " Credit card debt in America is an estimated $2.16 trillion. Over 2 million families filed for personal bankruptcy last year. Employees' financial worries cost employers countless dollars each year. Approximately 90% of Americans have never received any financial training. With personal debt soaring and personal savings decreasing, it's no wonder so many individuals find themselves in difficult financial situations. That's exactly why we are here.

The primary focus of the Centers for Financial Education (Centers), a division of Money Management International and its Consumer Credit Counseling Service Agencies, is to educate consumers. We believe that financial and credit education is the answer to many of the problems consumers face today. The Centers have made it their goal to provide a variety of educational services designed to help individuals everywhere take control of their financial situation and gain the peace of mind that comes from improved spending habits, increased savings, and the wise use of credit.















<strong>**Money Management International is approved to issue certificates evidencing completion of a personal financial management instructional course in compliance with the Bankruptcy Code. However, approval does not endorse or assure the quality of a Provider's services.</strong>";

The Centers' website is designed to be a resource for financial and credit information, and an interactive tool for participants in the Certified Money Management Volunteer program.

The Centers for Financial Education understand the importance of your privacy on the Internet. That is why we believe it is important to let you know how we use the information collected through the Centers' website. The following is our policy regarding Internet privacy and usage.

Money Management International, Inc. (MMI), the Centers' parent company, is continually researching and implementing the best reasonable security options available for protecting our data internally and over the Internet. In accordance with our standard security policy, information is not transferred to any third parties. Therefore, the security of your personal information is solely protected by MMI. Further, only authorized staff members have access to specific areas of consumer information.

Security

When you send confidential personal information to us we require that a \"secure session\" first be established using Secure Socket Layer (SSL). For further information about SSL and the safety and confidentiality of personal data transmissions over the Internet, please read our Net Security Statement.

Collection and Use of Information

You can visit our website without revealing any personal information about yourself or telling us who you are. We do not collect personal information, such as your name, address, phone number, or email address, while you browse. We do, however, gather information in aggregate on how this site is used, such as the number of visitors to the site, length of each visit, and which pages are most commonly used to enter and exit the site. Some areas of the website utilize browser cookies. These cookies are used for enhancing the usability of the website. You have the option of disabling cookies in your browser's preferences/options area (refer to your browser's help system for further explanation).
  
There are now, and will be, sections on the website that are provided for the benefit of the consuming public. You may request consumer educational information or other services in these sections. To fulfill your request, you may need to provide us with your email address, regular mail address, or telephone number. Our use of that information will be limited to the purpose of providing the requested information.
  
While at the website, you may voluntarily choose to schedule a program or seminar or register to become a participant of the Certified Money Management Volunteer program. In that case, several types of personal information are gathered for use in your database.  If you are scheduling a program, the information gathered will be used for contact purposes, completion of the presentation, and follow-up. If you are participating in the Certified Money Management Volunteer program, the information will be used to help you accomplish and complete your responsibilities as a volunteer.
  
We will not sell, rent, loan, trade, or lease any personal information collected at our site. All personal information is used solely at your direction.

We cannot and do not guarantee or warrant that files available for downloading through the site will be free of infection, viruses, worms, or other code that manifest contaminating or destructive qualities. You assume total responsibility and risk for your use of the site and the Internet.

Agreement

By using this website, you agree to our Internet Privacy and Usage Policy and to the use of the information we receive and collect as stated herein and in ways we may notify you of in the future. By providing any personal information to this site, you acknowledge that you fully understand and consent to the collection and processing of such information. We reserve the right at our discretion to modify this Internet Privacy and Usage Policy at any time. Your continued use of this site following the posting of changes to these terms means you accept these changes.

Net Security Statement

The Centers for Financial Education take the confidentiality of your information very seriously. That is why we utilize SSL technology to encrypt your Information Statement.
  
SSL stands for \"Secure Sockets Layer\" protocol. It was developed by Netscape Communications Corporation. SSL provides data security between application protocols such as HTTP (the protocol used by the Web) and the networking protocol TCP/IP. SSL sits between the network I/O and the data on your web server. SSL establishes a secure connection between the server and an SSL-capable browser then encrypts and decrypts information as it is sent and received.

By encrypting messages, SSL can assure that transactions are private and that information has not been altered during transmission. SSL can also authenticate the server to the browser by providing the server's certificate to the browser. The browser must be capable of using the SSL protocol, including verifying certificates and encrypting and decrypting messages. Several browsers, such as Spyglass Mosaic, Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator, support SSL.
  
Be attentive to the following situations to ensure your confidentiality is not compromised on your end. Your privacy might be compromised:

if someone else has access to your computer, and is able to read email or files stored on your disk
if you print email to/from the Centers on paper, and someone finds the paper
if you use a workplace computer - your employer has a legal right to read your email on that machine
if you accidentally make a mistake on the email address and send it to someone other than your MMI/Center consultant
if someone obtains the password to your email account
if you talk about it to someone";
